### Project Flow & Tracker

Node based scrum stack (backbone served by jade, run in the browser) under construction here...

An agile project process monitor, pft booted itself into existence during nodeknockout 2011. 

Business stories drill down into roles and user stories. Then this backlog is incrementally stacked into a self-documenting list of tasks assigned to the current sprint. You always know where you are because you can drill down and then zoom out, test and accept, and stack down to the next sprint. And so on.

note: Project Flow & Tracker was formerly based on Drupal, see https://github.com/victorkane/ProjectFlowAndTracker
